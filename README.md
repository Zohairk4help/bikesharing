# bikesharing_Module14

## **Brief Summary:** 

In this Module, I have benefited to gain and apply the knwoledge of analysing Bike-sharing data by using Tableau. In summary, Tableau is an advance version of Microsoft Excel and its Pivot tables. The only difference is that it can handle a very big data in few seconds ; excel, however, has limited number of rows and columuns and it can be sluggish when faced by a large amount of data. 

The Project is based on analyses of Bike-sharing data on Des Moines. This is done to prove to investors that this business decision will be a prudential one by keeping NYC bike-sharing data as a base. 

## **Results**

## ***Summary:***

After analysing the data, it is categorically seen that the males are the most active in the bike trips. 

According to the "World Population Review",
the population is further expected to increase in Desmoines. Thus, Male population is surely tend to increase too. Therefore, the bike-sharing business in Des Moines is a wise one!
